# Code-Quiz-CristianB


Quiz Application - part of Bootcamp challenge

It tests the knowledge gained in HTML, CSS and JavaScript during the last weeks, especially the implementation of javascript. It takes an array of objects as questions with one possible correct answer and create a nice webpage that interact with the user, calculate user correct answers to the displayedd question and display the high score at the end. The interaction is timed on timer and every wrong answer penalised the user with 10 seconds.
